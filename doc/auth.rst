============================
Authorisation and superusers
============================


Users
=====

Explain how users create accounts and login, and how they get and can use their 
API key - this is just an overview as the details should be in the API pages and 
so on.

Also point out that users can add other users to their collection as admins - 
giving them the same controls as the owner has.


Superusers
==========

Refer to config settings for how superusers can be listed, and how a superuser 
can go to any collection or user page and edit them.
